<h1>Work Experience</h1>
<body>I have spent an extensive amount of time in customer service. 2 1/2 of my years in customer service were working in the food industry. Throughout my experience I have gained a new understanding of my own communication skills. I have been given the opportunity to work with not only customers but coworkers on these skills. My problem solving skill has been heightened as well with all that may arise in customer service. </body>
<h2>Something Different Grill</h2>
<body>I worked at SDG for a total of 1 1/2 years. This was my first ever job so everything was still brand new to me. During this time I had just began working on my communication skills with others. I learned the proper way to speak to customers and coworkers. During my time here I learned all the basics a job may entail. This job essentailly taught me the basics I would take on to furture jobs.</body>
<h3>Sonic Drive Through</h3>
<body>I worked at Sonic for around 9 months. Sonic was a great work environment for me to continue working on my service skills. Sonic workers in my town started out with customer service and would eventually work their way up to working behind the counter and in the kitchen. I worked both as a Car Hop and in the Drive Through. Here as I continued to learn new communication skills I learned a bit about a fast paced place of work. I gained the ability to multitask and work under stress better.</body>
<h4>Main Event</h4>
<body>I am currently employed here as a Bowl Attendant. This job is quite a bit different from my previous ones. Here the level of stress can be elevated due to the attention Main Event grasps. Here I have dealt with speaking to several hundreds of people on a weekend. This job has allowed me to practice my skills working with my coworkers. A lot of the time we need several of us to find a solution to a problem. With these problems I have gained the opportunity to practice this skills.</body>

    <h1>High School</h1>

    <body>In high school I was apart of several organizations. First opportunity I joined in high school was the cheer team. I spent a total of 5 years as a cheerleader so a majority of my time was spent as a cheerleader in high school. I went to many competition over the years and though we never won a major competition I learned a lot from each loss. Through each loss we learned to perservere and keep pushing towards the finish line. We worked as a team no matter what and would continue to uplift one anothers spirits. Next I joined the marching band. Here is where I met some people who remain in my life as my best friends. These years taught me so much about myself and the people I will continue to surround myself with. One major part of my high school career was the early college program. This program allowed me to take almost entirely college courses and gain credit for both high school and towards college. I took a total of 60 credit hours and graduated with my Associates Degree in Liberal Arts. </body>
    <h2>College</h2>

    <body>As I mentioned above I was in a program that allowed me to gain my Associates Degree while also completing high school. This is an opportunity that I will forever be grateful for. When I originally heard of the program I saw it as something that would cause me to miss out on the "High School Experience." Yet I not only had some of the best experiences in my life during these years yet was able to put myself ahead. This opportunity taught me a bit about my own integrity. </body>
